        <p><span class="work-of-art-title">Golden Solid</span> is an exploration of the mathematical relationships between the regular pentagon, the regular dodecahedron, and the golden ratio.</p>

        <p>Plato believed that truth, beauty, and virtue were found in moderate and balanced proportions, a concept in philosophy known as the Golden Mean. He further described the regular solids as an expression of these proportions and theorized that the elements of the universe were composed of these shapes.</p>

        <p>This piece explores "arbitrary levels of nesting" in the form of a dodecahedron, which is a 12-sided solid for which each face is a regular pentagon. The two-dimensional pattern of pentagons from which a dodecahedron is constructed itself fits within larger adjacent pentagons. A pattern of six pentagons can then be scaled (to the smaller portion of the golden ratio, mysteriously) and placed inside each of its constituent pentagons. And so on.</p>

        <p>Nesting one, two, three, four, and five levels of pentagons creates emergent patterns that are difficult to express, but made possible by the precision of the laser cutter.</p>

        <p><span class="work-of-art-title">You Be You</span> is an exploration of the sometimes ambiguous and mutable nature of gender.</p>

        <p>My intention is editorial. The piece suggests a decent human response to members of our community who struggle with or assert a new identity – plain and uncomplicated acceptance.</p>

        <p>I chose to present the imagery in the form of a child's puzzle for two reasons. First, the current social and political issues surrounding gender are cast as complex issues that many adults avoid discussing with children. Second, I believe the message expresses basic human dignity that can be and is understood intuitively by toddlers.</p>

        <p>The pieces can be assembled using two options each of three sections of the full person. Regardless of configuration, we respond simply, “Ok.”</p>

        <p>René Magritte's seminal painting <span class="work-of-art-title">The Treachery of Images</span> illustrates the distance between representation and being. His work evokes comparison to Alfred Korzybski’s observation that “The word is not the thing” and “The map is not the territory”. Magritte revisited the idea later in life with Ceci n'est pas pomme, which sold at Christie’s in 2013 for 4.6 million dollars.</p>

        <p>This work, <span class="work-of-art-title">The Treachery of Magritte</span>, is intended to celebrate the artist’s insight and incorporates elements of his source imagery, specifically the french text and tracings of the frame. Additionally, it explores the lexical complexity of the use of symbols in modern corporate branding. Apple, Inc. sells tens of millions of computer and communications devices every year with one of the world’s most recognizable logos. However, an iPhone is not an apple. You can’t eat it and it doesn’t grow on trees. And yet this work is engraved directly upon an Apple, Inc. designed and manufactured artifact.</p>

        <p>Shepard Fairey is a contemporary artist and graphic designer who famously injected himself into the public consciousness by giving away and otherwise distributing enormous quantities of his work. His Andre the Giant Has a Posse was exceptional for, arguably, creating a new type of what Walter Benjamin called “aura” by eschewing monetary value in exchange for the cultural currency of association with hip hop and skater subcultures. In 1994, under the threat of lawsuit, Fairey created a stylized version of Andre’s face, removed his trademarked name, and added the ominous text “OBEY” as an antiauthoritarian response. In 2008, mass production of Fairey’s “HOPE” poster helped elect America’s first minority president.</p>

        <p>Ocho Andres appropriates, replicates, and duplicates Fairey’s work and re-contextualizes the imagery as an exploration of the relationship between the artist and society. The piece walks the line between mass consumer popular culture and conceptual commentary, between creative work and shameless ripoff, and between message and ambiguity. The sarcastic “OBEY” on a red field has been replaced by the directive to “REPRODUCE” on a green field. Oppression is replaced by stern encouragement. Threat is replaced by a playful call to action. The piece intends to encourage us to embrace the possibilities of new tools in a new world of endless reproducibility.</p>

      how is it, stranger,
      that you came to know
      the hidden contents of this heart?

      who divulged my secrets
      my private designs
      that you might draw them out
      into the air
      with your bow

      with wood and rosin
      string and empty space?

      who disclosed my business
      that you might
      assault me unawares
      in this terminal passage
      now enchanted
      transfigured
      made prayerful

      you play the innocent
      but your merciless strokes
      lay siege to these halls
      and I stand transfixed

      my longings stand betrayed
      my sufferings
      the deep self

      is it, indeed, that I am as nothing
      my spirit pretentious and simple?

      or is it that somehow
      we are something

      one in the underneath
