        <p>In this seminal work, Benjamin describes the changing nature of art away from uniqueness and toward ubiquity. Historically, the uniqueness of works of art lent them an authenticity and a magical or ritualistic power that Benjamin defines as an "aura." Technological advances have greatly increased the reproducibility of art, from prints and mass production to radio and television. Reproduction depreciates the cultural aura of the original while allowing the work to meet its audience on the observer’s terms, in their own spaces. Benjamin suggests that art can be valued on a spectrum ranging from cult value to exhibition (art for art’s sake) value. Reproducibility pushes strongly toward the later.</p>
        <p>In this way, photography and film have transformed not only the particulars, but the nature of art. While theatre exists in relationship with its audience, film provides both detached observation, which places the audience in the position of the critic, and alienation for the performer while producing the film.</p>
        <p>Benjamin insists that we need to proactively explore how to create meaning and project aura in the modern age:</p>
        <p>"The tasks which face the human apparatus of perception at the turning points of history cannot be solved by optical means, that is, by contemplation, alone. They are mastered gradually by habit, under the guidance of tactile appropriation."</p>
        <p>Benjamin’s essay lays the groundwork for my exploration of the integration of technology into the creative process and distribution.</p>

        <p>Jos De Mul is a professor of philosophy and human culture at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. This essay is a response to and 21st century extension of Walter Benjamin’s seminal work, affirming the assertion that cult value has, indeed, been replaced by exhibition value. Aura must now be generated through manipulation or personalization – limited edition prints and signed copies being simple examples.</p>
        <p>De Mul’s thesis is that the database is the ontological model of modern works of art. In the computer age, all artifacts are data, and all data is subject to fundamental actions: Add, Browse, Change, and Destroy. Because of the ease of digital distribution, participatory "manipulation value" is taking the place of "exhibition value". Manipulation by the audience or by new creators establishes a fresh aura. The infinite recombination possibilities that databases provide allow for unique expressions of re-interpretation and contextualization. These manipulations are both made possible by, and draw attention to, the digital mediums of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>This work is a great starting point for my exploration of the nature, value, and possibilities of 21st-century creative collaboration. He clearly introduces re-mixing culture, where previous works are not just reproduced and widely available, but are referenced or used as elements in new "original" works.</p>

        <p>A fabrication laboratory (fab lab) is a globally-networked local workshop offering digitally enhanced machines such as laser cutters, 3D printers, and CNC machines. The first lab opened in 2001 within MIT’s Media Lab.</p>
        <p>Digitally empowered tools have captured the popular imagination, appearing in futuristic form as Star Trek replicators and in real-world form on The Big Bang Theory.</p>
        <p>Culturally, fabrication labs provide a badly needed counterbalance to a longstanding trend toward abstraction and consumerism. Digital fabrication allows individuals and communities to shift back toward a "maker" culture of creative material output and increased capacity for self-reliance. From the beginning, the fab lab has been interdisciplinary and collaborative, an extension of the open source software movement. The Fab Charter expresses the principled intention "to empower, to educate, and to create ‘almost anything’".</p>
        <p>This book lays the groundwork for my understanding of one environment in which creative collaboration is developing in new ways and in new mediums. It explores some of the social pitfalls (domination by young, educated, white males, for example) and legal tensions (fix-it-yourself vs. copyright, warrantee, and liability).</p>

        <p>This work explores new frontiers of design driven by biomimicry, algorithms, and other iterative processes.</p>
        <p>With traditional compositional design and manufacturing, many projects were impossible. For example, a conch shell could not be reproduced. Now, with 3D printing and generative design, not only can we print the form, but we can use computation to develop novel shapes based on similar first principles. Wonderful complexity can emerge from the iterative application of simple rules.</p>
        <p>These techniques are being applied across many disciplines. New designs are appearing in furniture, jewelry, household items, fashion, and architecture. The additive nature of digital manufacturing eliminate waste and reduces environmental footprints.</p>
        <p>Additionally, new vistas appear from the integration of computer technologies into the design process: "Writing and hacking software has become part of the design process."</p>
        <p>This work is of interest because I want to explore technologically mediated creative habits. New mediums released by technology are central to that exploration.</p>

        <p>Digital fabrication is still in its infancy. The scale of digital manufacturing is small enough that it has not yet confronted many inevitable legal issues that personal computer software has faced over the last four decades. Fab labs, like high quality printers, are capable of manufacturing illegal materials such as weapons, drug paraphernalia, counterfeit products, or shoddy, unsafe items. Tort law has not yet been tested in cases involving digital manufacturing, where the object designer, machine designer, personal manufacturer, and companies involved in integrated products might all reasonably be held partially or fully responsible for injury related to product failure or unsuitability.</p>
        <p>There are several legal and intellectual property mechanisms which will come into play for fabricated items over the coming years. The ease with which makers can infringe upon trademarks will lead to "take down" notices. In the case of copyright, the line at which a new design is considered a "derivative work" is particularly thorny. Patents are also likely to create issues, as the public exposure of patented technologies inherently makes them replicable to skilled makers. Digital Rights Management (DRM) and micro-patents may play a role in protecting commercial designs, but a vibrant open hardware culture has already developed in fabrication circles. The RepRap and Fab@Home 3-D printers are examples of community-driven, open source hardware that can print their own replacement parts.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, personal digital fabrication is a new frontier. Only time will tell if maker tools kick off a flowering of productivity or shift the economic power structures we know today.</p>
        <p>In my own research it is important to develop clear definitions of derivative work and fair use.</p>

        <p>The emergence of digital fabrication laboratories has had an impact not only on the discipline of architecture, but also on its associated pedagogies and the resultant creative cultures.</p>
        <p>This article tracks the development of architectural pedagogy as architecture evolved from an art of necessity in the ancient world toward the higher arts in the renaissance and beyond. In past ages, architectural skill was transmitted by various combinations of apprenticeship, guilds, academies, and independent studios. In the 20th century, studios and model shops were integrated into schools of architecture and eventually the science lab and computer technology were introduced. The advent of computer-aided design almost eliminated physical scale models from the curriculum. However, they reemerged with radically lower costs of modification and replication when fab labs migrated from engineering programs into architecture.</p>
        <p>Educational institutions have largely chosen to focus on integration of fab labs into existing coursework rather than focus on the tools as a subject. Scientific method has become the ultimate touchstone for pedagogy. Rather than focusing only on the transmission of information, laboratories provide an ecosystem for inquiry. Instructors teach at increasing levels of freedom as students become more experienced, with advanced students provided only with complex sets of objectives and developing their own methodologies and lines of experimentation. Such methodical study and scientific inquiry are the reason these facilities deserve to be called ‘labs’ rather than ‘workshops’.</p>
        <p>The emergence of new types of creative and craft communities mediated and empowered by new technologies, in this case fabrication labs, illuminates elements of healthy creative ecosystems, which is my line of inquiry.</p>

        <p>MIT has been the center of technological revolutions for many decades and serves as the setting for this seminal exploration of emerging tech culture. After a transistorized computer called TX-0 ("Tixo") was designed and built in the mid-1950s, a new culture of students and technologists grew up around it through the 1960s.</p>

        <p>A set of ethics and a platform emerged gradually and with no explicit assertion. The first plank of the unspoken platform was: "Access to computers–and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works–should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!" Second, "information should be free," not just technical know-how, but the source code of software tools as well. Third, mistrust authority, shun bureaucracy, and promote decentralization. Fourth, favor meritocracy and ignore credentials and social position. Fifth, embrace new aesthetic possibilities, that art and beauty can be created on a computer, and that elegant software is, itself, a medium of expression.</p>

        <p>As their skill grew, their projects became more complex, such as software that can play chess. This first generation of computer hackers didn't know whether the world would embrace their passion for new possibilities. Regardless, a new world with vistas never before experienced was taking shape in computer labs.</p>

        <p>In my view, hacker culture is evidence that, freed from structure and forced hierarchy, humans are optimized for collaborative creativity. Structure and institutions are waning and are being replaced by the power of the individual to self-organize into decentralized groups inspired to build a new world.</p>

        <p>Professor Barrett is Head of the School of Music and Director of the Creative Collaboratorium Research Group at The University of Queensland, Australia. Her book challenges the prevailing Western romantic notion of the individual creator. She asserts that musical creativity is not the result of isolated genius, but born in the a matrix of culture, teaching, and collaboration.</p>
        <p>The prevailing view of the "creative imaginary" is burdened by several tensions. First, current research reveals that creativity is not a general state of being, but the result of mastery of a particular domain of knowledge – a particular musical instrument, for example. Second, defining and measuring creative output in a collaborative setting requires us to redefine creative output beyond simply ‘novel’ and ‘appropriate’ (culturally valued). Third, creativity exists on multiple discernible levels, which are available to practitioners at different levels of expertise. While even small children can be creative on an individual plane, a master might make paradigm-shifting, historic contributions to the field. Fourth, even paradigms which acknowledge that ‘creativity’ is judged in a social context of knowledgeable peers persist in reinforcing the view that creative work is the output of one individual.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barrett’s clarity provides a platform from which I can better define creative goals – essential to the work of devising tools and practices that reinforce creative habits.</p>

        <p>This article explores the effects, experiences, and benefits of collaboration between emerging composers and a full professional orchestra. This rare opportunity was facilitated at a five-day collaborative ecosystem known as Composers’ School.</p>
        <p>Music notation supports three essential musical functions: conception, communication, and conservation. During creation or conception of new music, notation provides "a ‘formal problem-solving space’ unconstrained by the real-time flow of performance." Committing ideas to the ‘code’ of music notation engages processes of understanding and refining, much like articulating half-formed thoughts in textual form enhances and clarifies them. The notated score serves as the medium of communication between the composer and the conductor and ensemble of performers. The score facilitates multiple types and directions of collaboration.</p>
        <p>Constraints limit and define the types of collaboration that can exist between a composer and ensemble and guide the composer toward certain best practices. The first constraint is limited rehearsal time, which leads composers to the realization that communicating sight-readable parts to the players is essential to getting a work performed successfully. Furthermore, the intentions of the score must be conveyed in the notation with a balance between clarity and respect for the expressive expertise of the performers. The second constraint is the clear power hierarchy in a traditional orchestra, which leaves little room for the composer in rehearsal and leads to, at best, a sequential, indirect collaboration where rehearsal inspires revisions.</p>
        <p>This article articulates for me the qualities of conventional creative artifacts that facilitate success in the process and relationships of an artistic collaboration.</p>

        <p>Wayne McGregor is one of the world’s most distinguished choreographers and describes the human body as our most literate tool of communication.</p>
        <p>For McGregor, Dance is a form of "physical thinking" or "kinesthetic intelligence" and the process of choreography, of creating dances, is a "distributed cognitive process." He collaborates, of course, with his troupe of dancers to solve the challenges of creating original movement. Beyond this, his works and their themes, their intellectual spines, are created in association with anthropologists, economists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and other practitioners of science and technology.</p>
        <p>This lecture is extraordinary for demonstrating, in real-time, in front of an audience, several methodologies of creation. The first technique involves generating original movement in relation to a simple core idea while his collaborators, two of his dancers, capture that movement and commit it to memory. as he continues to generate new material, quickly resulting in a complete dance phrase. In the second technique, he relates to the dancers as architectural "objects to think with." He guides the creation of a duet through rapid-fire instructions ("arm to the floor", "underneath, jump", "can you put your leg over?", "spin her around", "can you rotate?"). Finally, he uses a task-based technique to pose challenges that the dancers solve as autonomous co-creators. Using these three methods of physical thinking, a one-minute original work is created and committed to memory in just under nine minutes.</p>

        <p>Twyla Tharp possesses the rare combination of extraordinary artistic success (as a preeminent post-modern choreographer) together with a willingness to demystify her creativity and share it with the public. Tharp’s guidance is experiential. While she references the habits of creative geniuses like Igor Stravinsky or Jerome Robbins, she is herself the central model of her own guidance and her considerable accomplishments establish an unassailable authority.</p>
        <p>Tharp believes we each have unique creative DNA, proclivities for viewing the world from certain focal lengths, a particular psychological stance, and unique passions, for example. This personal creative potential can only be unleashed, however, through rigor and discipline. What results is a Ben Franklin-esque treatise of success through virtuous habit.</p>
        <p>The book alternates between guidance supported by anecdotes and exercises to release our capacity. In her guidance, Tharp emphasizes preparation, ritual, organization, and relentless self-discipline. She stresses the relationship between generosity and reciprocal ‘luck’ and insists that we study and work with only the best. She entreats us to work hard to master the skills of our medium while remaining flexible and embracing change and ambiguity.</p>
        <p>Her exercises are a treasure-trove of her personal strategies for releasing creativity or getting unstuck from a rut. These exercises provide a set of techniques that can contribute to a core of practices in the digitally mediated creative communities that I am considering.</p>

        <p>In this sequel to her groundbreaking contributions in <i>The Creative Habit</i>, preeminent American post-modern choreographer Twyla Tharp describes the habits of extraordinary creative collaboration through wisdom gleaned from her own experiences. Tharp promotes disciplined preparation and the cultivation of habit, both in art and in the skills of working together. She details her collaborations with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gregory Hines, Bob Dylan, David Byrnes, Elvis Costello, Danny Elfman, Jerome Robbins, Frank Sinatra, and others. In doing so, she suggests that the artist aim ambitiously high, while working selflessly for the whole. She insists that collaboration is not only human nature, but the currency of success in our time and for the future. Joint efforts succeed when there is clarity of purpose, commitment, flexibility, selflessness, gratitude, and mutual respect. In such healthy collaborations, the sum is always greater than it’s parts.</p>
        <p>While Twyla Tharp’s insights are largely anecdotal and experiential, the value of her contributions is firmly established by both her personal success and the acclaim of her peers. Her insights provide pragmatic tools that establish guidelines for building creative communities and building successful collaborative creative habits.</p>
