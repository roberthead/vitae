    %h2 Professional Summary
    %p
      For almost two decades, I have led teams of software developers delivering high-profile Web applications.  My e-commerce expertise was earned in the trenches at Amazon.com and building new commerce platforms from scratch at both paizo.com and shopdragon.com.  My methodologies are agile, collaborative, and test-driven and my favored technology ecosystem is Ruby on Rails.
